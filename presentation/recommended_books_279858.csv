006091341X,The Bridge of San Luis Rey (Perennial Classics),Thornton Wilder,1986,Harpercollins,"This beautiful new edition features unpublished notes for the novel and other illuminating documentary material, all of which is included in a new Afterword by Tappan Wilder. ""On Friday noon, July the twentieth, 1714, the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travelers into the gulf below."" With this celebrated sentence Thornton Wilder begins ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey,"" one of the towering achievements in American fiction and a novel read throughout the world. By chance, a monk witnesses the tragedy. Brother Juniper then embarks on a quest to prove that it was divine intervention rather than chance that led to the deaths of those who perished in the tragedy. His search leads to his own death -- and to the author's timeless investigation into the nature of love and the meaning of the human condition. This new edition of Wilder' s 1928 Pulitzer Prize winning novel contains a new foreword by Russell Banks.",Fiction,en,"The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1927) tells the story of several unrelated people who happen to be on a bridge in Peru when it collapses, killing them. Philosophically, the book explores the problem of evil, or the question, of why unfortunate events occur to people who seem ""innocent"" or ""undeserving"". It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928, and in 1998 it was selected by the editorial board of the American Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of the twentieth century. The book was quoted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair during the memorial service for victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Since then its popularity has grown enormously. The book is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film-making, where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks to events before the disaster.","Accident victims, Accidents, American fiction, Bridges, Fiction, History, Pulitzer Prize Winner, Russian language, Text, Translations into Spanish, award:pulitzer_prize=1928, award:pulitzer_prize=fiction, 18.06 Anglo-American literature, American fiction (fictional works by one author), Fiction, historical, Peru, fiction, Large type books, Fiction, historical, general, Social life and customs, Manners and customs, Thornton Wilder, Pulitzer Prize, Winner, Historical, American, Adult, Classic, Literature, Stories, Story, Book, Books, Religion, Religious, Tragedy, Tragedies, Death, Fate, Divine, Intervention, Amy Drevenstedt, Peru, Latin America, South America, USA, 18th century, 20th century, 18th Century / 20th Century",English

She wanted nothing to do with a low-down, lying sneak. But Max wouldn't leave without getting everything he wanted - and that included Claire."" -- Back cover.",Fiction,en,"Claire Westerbrook couldn't believe it. She had met a man like no other, a man who might very well be the man. He was sexy, witty, charming - and a total imposter. He was Max Conroy, and he had a job to do.
